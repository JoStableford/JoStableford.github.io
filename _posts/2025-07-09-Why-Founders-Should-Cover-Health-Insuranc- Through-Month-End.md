# Why Founders Should Cover Health Insurance Through Month-End (or Longer)

**It’s not just generous. It’s one of the simplest, lowest-cost ways to reduce harm during a layoff.**

---

Startups move fast. Sometimes painfully fast.

You pivot. You restructure. You tighten the team to extend runway. But what often gets overlooked in those decisions is what happens *after* someone walks out the door.

Not the headline in the all-hands. Not the bullet in the severance email. But the detail that quietly determines whether someone can refill a prescription or take their kid to the doctor the next week:

**When does their health insurance actually end?**



## The Hidden Gap: Why COBRA Leaves People Exposed

Here’s what most founders (and even some HR teams) don’t realize:

When someone loses their job, they have a few paths to stay insured:

- Join a partner’s plan  
- Pick a Marketplace plan  
- Elect COBRA to stay on their old coverage  

But COBRA comes with a **built-in delay**.

Legally, the timeline looks like this:

1. Employer notifies the plan → within 30 days  
2. Plan sends the election packet → within 14 days  
3. Employee receives it (usually by mail)  
4. Only *then* can they elect and pay

That’s up to **45 days** with no active coverage.

Yes, COBRA will eventually backdate. But that doesn’t help when your child’s appointment is next week. Or your insulin runs out tomorrow. Or if the pharmacy won't fill your prescription out of pocket.


## The Worst Case? Ending Coverage on Termination Day

Most plans give you a choice when setting the rules:

1. ❌ End coverage *on* the termination date  
2. ✅ Extend coverage *through* the end of the month  

Note: If your plan uses the second option—and you lay someone off on June 30—they wake up July 1 uninsured, same as the first option with no way to reinstate coverage for weeks.

That's not just unfortunate. It's avoidable.


## The Fix: Build a Buffer Into Your Plan

If you choose “coverage through month-end,” you:

- Automatically give people a grace window while COBRA catches up  
- Let families refill medications or handle care without panic  
- Avoid forcing impossible decisions in already-vulnerable moments  

It costs almost nothing—especially if you’re paying monthly premiums anyway.

And if you’re planning a larger layoff, you can go further:

- Stagger exits earlier in the month  
- Subsidize 1–2 months of COBRA where it matters  
- Communicate clearly about what to expect  


## This Is What Leadership Looks Like

People don’t just lose income in a layoff.  
They lose predictability.  
They lose access to care.  
They lose the small sense of control that helps them keep going.

You can’t remove all the pain. But you *can* remove this part.


## TL;DR: What to Do

- ✅ Choose “end of month” coverage when renewing your benefits plan  
- 🛠️ Avoid last-day-of-month terminations when possible  
- 💸 Subsidize COBRA selectively if budget allows  
- 🗣️ Explain the timeline during offboarding  

These aren’t HR details. They’re leadership choices.

Because how you let people go says just as much as how you brought them in.
