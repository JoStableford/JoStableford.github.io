Who would I be in Westeros? AI tried to tell me.

One of the habits I’ve been building lately is something I call “AI playtime.” Not for productivity. Not for efficiency. Just curiosity. Exploration. Low-stakes experimentation with how AI might help in daily life- whether it’s something I need, or just something I’m thinking about.

Sometimes that means drafting policies or cleaning up a grant proposal. Sometimes it’s reworking a recipe or brainstorming event copy. Today, it was something else entirely:

“Based on what you know of me… who would I be in Westeros?”

Down the rabbit hole we went.


## A Return to the Realm

This started with an offhand complaint: Facebook keeps serving me Game of Thrones ads. I read the books when they came out. I watched the show... and like many, had feelings when it drifted off-book. Frustrations aside, I still think it’s one of the most ambitious, textured mythologies ever put on screen.

So today’s AI prompt was rooted in long-time fandom:

“Based on what you know of me (my values, leadership style, how I work), who would I be in Game of Thrones?”

The answers were thoughtful. Surprisingly accurate. And unexpectedly, insightful.


## First Up: Sansa Stark

Not early-seasons Sansa (the court-obsessed teenager), but the version who survives, adapts, and leads. The Queen in the North. Not because she chased power, but because she earned trust.

The alignment made sense: strategic, composed, emotionally intelligent, systems-savvy. Sansa doesn’t wield brute force. She plays the long game. Navigates power without becoming consumed by it. The AI highlighted how I’ve led in complex landscapes, stayed principled, and remain rooted in the community I serve.

But it also called out differences.

Where Sansa holds back until she’s sure, I tend to speak up early. Where she leans into quiet diplomacy, I’m more direct. And while she had to unlearn blind trust in institutions, I’ve always approached systems with healthy skepticism.


## Then Came Ser Davos Seaworth

The Onion Knight. Smuggler turned knight, lord, advisor. Not polished. Not born to power. But one of the most grounded, pragmatic, moral leaders in Westeros.

This one hit home. I’ve earned trust in organizations not through title, academic achievements, or volume... but through clarity, follow-through, and principled action. Like Davos, I bridge roles: grassroots and leadership, community and policy, and work to make systems serve people better.

But again, some divergence.

Davos hesitates to assert authority. I don’t. I’ll step in, speak plainly, and move things forward when they need moving. And while he skirts the structure, I’m often deep inside it, restructuring for the better as I go.


## A Few More Faces

The AI also floated Brienne (for principled service), Jon Snow (reluctant leadership), and Tyrion (strategic honesty, with a side of sarcasm). All fair. All circling the same theme:

People who don’t chase power, but don’t shy away from responsibility.


## So Why Bother?

This didn’t solve a problem. It didn’t knock out a task. But it did make something obvious:

This AI, just from our strings of fundraiser planning, policy drafting, resume reviews, and random tangents, has picked up how I work. Just through pattern. Through repetition. Through the shape of the questions I ask, and how I structure a solution.

And when I tossed it a left-field prompt on a Sunday morning of  "Who would I be in Westeros?"... it gave back something thoughtful. Something that reflected more than just fandom.

Which is weird. And kind of fascinating. And exactly why I keep doing this.

This “AI playtime” isn’t about novelty. It’s about stretch. It keeps me sharp. It pushes how I think about the tool... and how I see myself.

So: part Sansa, part Ser Davos.

Could be worse.
