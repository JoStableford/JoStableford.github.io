# AI, Identity, and a Game of Thrones Thought Experiment (or: Who Would I Be in Westeros? AI Tried to Tell Me)

One of the habits I’ve been trying to build lately is giving myself space each day for what I call **“AI playtime.”** Not productivity. Not automation. Just curiosity. Exploration. Low-stakes experimentation with how AI can help in everyday life—whether it’s something I need, or just something I’m thinking about.

Sometimes I use it to draft policies or clean up a grant proposal. Sometimes I ask it to rework a recipe or brainstorm event copy. Today, I asked something entirely different:

**“Based on what you know of me… who would I be in Westeros?”**

And down the rabbit hole we went.

## 📜 A Return to the Realm

It started with an offhand complaint: Facebook keeps serving me *Game of Thrones* ads. I read the books when they came out. I watched the show (and, like many, had feelings when it drifted off-book). Frustrations aside, I still think it’s one of the most ambitious and textured mythologies ever put on screen.

(*Yes, I had to stop mid-message to find the right word—“mythos.” Not “franchise,” not “enterprise.” Mythos.*)

So, as part of today’s “AI play,” I gave a prompt rooted in my long love of the story:

> “Based on what you know of me from our chats—my values, leadership style, how I work—who would I be in Game of Thrones?”

The answers were thoughtful, accurate… and kind of insightful in a way I didn’t expect.

## 👑 First Up: Sansa Stark

Not early-seasons Sansa—the court-obsessed, romance-dreaming teenager—but the version who survives, learns, adapts, and ultimately leads. The Sansa who becomes Queen in the North not because she chases power, but because she’s the one people trust to protect them.

The alignment felt clear: strategic, composed, systems-savvy, emotionally intelligent. Sansa doesn’t wield brute force—she plays the long game. She knows how to navigate the politics of power without becoming corrupted by it. The AI noted how I’ve taken on leadership in messy systems, led with principle, and stayed centered on community and fairness.

But it also noted where we diverge.

Where Sansa can sometimes hesitate to speak until she’s absolutely sure, I’m usually quicker to call something out if it’s broken. Where she leans into quiet diplomacy, I’m more direct. And while she had to unlearn blind trust in authority, I’ve generally approached institutions with a healthy dose of skepticism from the outset.

## 🧅 Then Came Ser Davos Seaworth

The Onion Knight. Smuggler turned knight, lord, and trusted advisor. Not born to power, not polished—but one of the most grounded, moral, and pragmatic figures in Westeros. He leads through humility and action. He’s not loud—but people listen. He’s not noble by blood—but he’s noble in every way that counts.

The resonance here was strong. I’ve built trust in organizations not through title or noise, but by getting things done, staying principled, and making systems work for the people who need them. Like Davos, I work across boundaries—grassroots and leadership, community and policy—and try to bridge what’s broken.

Again, not a perfect match.  
Davos sometimes hesitates to claim space or assert authority. I don’t tend to have that problem. I’ll step in, speak plainly, and move things forward when they need moving. And where he avoids the power structure, I’m often the one inside it, restructuring how it works.

## 🧠 A Few More Faces Along the Way…

The AI also floated Brienne (for principled service), Jon Snow (for reluctant-but-capable leadership), and Tyrion (for strategic honesty, with a side of sarcasm). All fair. All part of the same theme: people who don’t chase power—but don’t shy away from responsibility either.

## 🎯 So Why Bother With Any of This?

This didn’t solve a problem. It didn’t automate a task or get anything off my to-do list. But it *did* make something obvious:

This AI —just from our running history of non-profit fundraiser planning, policy and document drafting, resume reviewing, weird hypotheticals, and the occasional late-night tangent— has picked up a lot about how I work.

Not through anything creepy. Just through volume. Through repetition. Through the way I ask questions, challenge assumptions, and structure things. And when I asked it, offhandedly, “Who would I be in Westeros?” it pulled from that running thread of interactions and gave me answers that were… honestly, pretty on point.

Which is interesting.  
Also a little weird.  
But ultimately kind of the reason I do this in the first place.

This “AI playtime” habit isn’t about novelty. It’s about stretching how I use the tool. It’s a way to push on what’s possible, stay sharp, and remind myself that AI isn’t just for cleaning up spreadsheets or speeding up copywriting. Sometimes it’s for kicking the tires on your own reflection—and seeing what comes back.

So yeah, apparently I’m part Sansa Stark, part Ser Davos.  
Could be worse.
