# My Personality Flaw? I Make Spreadsheets for Everything.  
*And I’m not even sorry—except when I have to explain VLOOKUP to someone again.*

They say awareness is the first step. So here I am, fully aware and entirely unrepentant:  
**I make spreadsheets. For everything.**  
Not just for taxes or budgets—*everything.*

Some people journal to reflect. Others unwind with exercise.  
I open Google Sheets and start a new tab titled `Outreach_Tracker_Master`—with filters, conditional formatting, and a drop-down menu for emotional resilience.


## A Peek Inside My Spreadsheet Safari

- A **band evaluation tool**, quantifying “hype” using Facebook likes, Instagram followers, YouTube views, and an unscientific “vibe” rating. Because talent is great, but can they bring a crowd?
- A **donation inventory**, sorting clothes by size, style, and questionable past fashion choices. Some items are tagged *“we all make mistakes.”*
- A **fundraising profit calculator** with automatic revenue projections based on ticket tiers, capacity, vendor fees, and weather-induced attrition.
- **Outreach trackers** galore—for job applications, vendor follow-ups, coordination logs, and that one person who ghosted me after asking for info (*you're still in the sheet, buddy*).


## The Real Struggle: Collaboration

At some point, every spreadsheet enthusiast makes the tragic mistake of **sharing** their beautiful creation.

That’s when the heartbreak begins.

You send it off, clean and clear.  
You explain, nicely, what to fill in.  
And then…

- Someone deletes a formula.  
- Someone types over the header.  
- Someone texts you their update instead because *“the sheet was confusing.”*

Worse: **`Copy of...`** enters the chat.  
You get back a new version that someone downloaded to open on their desktop in excel titled `Copy of Tracker`, but the formulas are gone, and someone has helpfully sorted the data.. *permanently.*

Suddenly, you’re not managing a spreadsheet. You’re managing a fragile, multi-user trust experiment.


## Yes, I Use Scripts. Obviously.

At some point, formulas just aren’t enough.

So yes, I’ve dipped into **Apps Script**.

- To generate **sequential ticket numbers and multi-requirement autofills** for an event with 1,000+ attendees? Absolutely.  
- To create a filtered **onboarding tracker** that feeds updates to a main dashboard based on input to separate tabs organized by mentor? Of course.

At this point, I don’t *just* spreadsheet—I automate.  
And yes, the scripts are documented. In a spreadsheet.


## I Could Stop. But Why Would I?

Yes, I *could* just write things down. I could let life happen without building a sorting mechanism for it.

But if I didn’t know which bands were worth inviting to a festival, what my clothes inventory looks like for donating, how much profit we’ll *probably* make on the next fundraiser, or which mentees haven’t completed step three of onboarding...  
Well, I wouldn’t feel like *me.*

Besides, someone’s got to make sense of the chaos. Might as well be me with filters, protected and locked cells, and automated email triggers.


## And If You’re One of Us...

I see you.  
With your multi-tabbed planning docs. Your nested `IF` statements. Your lovingly labeled `Summary View` dashboards.  
You don’t need fixing.

And if you do, I’ve got a script for that.
